| 0-1 Knapsack Problem: Imagine you are a thief and you want to steal things with room full of things. You have a knapsack which can handle maximum capacity of weight W, and you want to fill it up such that it's worth is maximum. Being an intelligent thief, you know weights and values of each item in room. How would you fill your knapsack, such that you get the maximum possible value, such that you can only fill upto capacity W.|[0_1_knapsack_problem.cpp](dynamic_programming_problems/0_1_knapsack_problem.cpp)|
