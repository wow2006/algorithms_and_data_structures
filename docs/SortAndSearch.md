| Given a sorted vector, return first index of the occurrence of a value in vector, if number does not exist, return -1 | [first_occurrence_binary_search.cpp](sort_search_problems/first_occurrence_binary_search.cpp) |
| Find the first repeating element in an array of integers. Given an array of integers, find the first repeating element in it. We need to find the element that occurs more than once and whose index of first occurrence is smallest.| [firstRepeatingElement.cpp](sort_search_problems/firstRepeatingElement.cpp)|
| Given a list of unsorted integers, A={a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>,…,a<sub>N</sub>}, Find the pair of elements that have the smallest absolute difference between them? If there are multiple pairs, find them all.| [closest_numbers.cpp](sort_search_problems/closest_numbers.cpp)|
| Given a sorted array, determine index of fixed point in this array. If array does not have a fixed point return -1. An array has a fixed point when index of the element is same as index i.e. i == arr[i], Expected time complexity O(logn)| [fixedPoint.cpp](sort_search_problems/fixedPoint.cpp)|
| Find the maximum element in an array which is first increasing and then decreasing. Input: arr[] = {8, 10, 20, 80, 100, 200, 400, 500, 3, 2, 1}, output : 500. Array may be strictly increasing or decreasing as well. ExpectedTime complexity is O(logn).| [findMaximum.cpp](sort_search_problems/findMaximum.cpp)|
| Given an array of positive and/or negative integers, find a pair in the array whose sum is closest to 0.| [findClosestPairToZero.cpp](sort_search_problems/findClosestPairToZero.cpp)|
| Numeros, the Artist, had two lists A and B, such that B was a permutation of A. Numeros was very proud of these lists. Unfortunately, while transporting them from one exhibition to another, some numbers were left out of A. Can you find the missing numbers? Notes: <ul><li>If a number occurs multiple times in the lists, you must ensure that the frequency of that number in both lists is the same. If that is not the case, then it is also a missing number.</li></ul><ul><li>You have to print all the missing numbers in ascending order.</li></ul><ul><li>Print each missing number once, even if it is missing multiple times.</li></ul><ul><li>The difference between maximum and minimum number in B is less than or equal to 100.</li></ul>. <ul><li> There will be four lines of input: n - the size of the first list, This is followed by n space-separated integers that make up the first list. m - the size of the second list. This is followed by m space-separated integers that make up the second list. Output the missing numbers in ascending order.| [missingNumbers.cpp](sort_search_problems/missingNumbers.cpp)|
| Find the closest pair from two sorted arrays. Given two sorted arrays and a number x, find the pair whose sum is closest to x and the pair has an element from each array. We are given two arrays ar1[0…m-1] and ar2[0..n-1] and a number x, we need to find the pair ar1[i] + ar2[j] such that absolute value of (ar1[i] + ar2[j] – x) is minimum.| [closestPairSorted.cpp](sort_search_problems/closestPairSorted.cpp)|
| Given an array A of n elements, find three indices i, j and k such that A[i]^2 + A[j]^2 = A[K]^2. O(n2) time complexity and O(1) space complexity | [squareSum.cpp](sort_search_problems/squareSum.cpp)|
| Given an unsorted array arr[0..n-1] of size n, find the minimum length subarray arr[s..e] such that sorting this subarray makes the whole array sorted. |[minLengthUnsortedArray.cpp](sort_search_problems/minLengthUnsortedArray.cpp)|
| Find the missing number in Arithmetic Progression | [missingNumber2.cpp](sort_search_problems/missingNumber2.cpp) |
| Find the common elements in 3 sorted vectors | [commonIn3Arrays.cpp](sort_search_problems/commonIn3Arrays.cpp) |
| Find all the pairs with a given sum in an unsorted array/vector | [find_pairs_with_sum.cpp](sort_search_problems/find_pairs_with_sum.cpp) |
| Given an array, find peak element in it. A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.| [peak_element.cpp](sort_search_problems/peak_element.cpp) |
| Given a sorted array of distinct non-negative integers, find smallest missing element in it.| [smallest_missing.cpp](sort_search_problems/smallest_missing.cpp)|
| Move all zeros in the vector to the end | [move_zeros.cpp](sort_search_problems/move_zeros.cpp)|
