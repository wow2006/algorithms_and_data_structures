| Depth First Traversal of a Graph | [dfsDemo.cpp](graph_problems/dfsDemo.cpp) |
| Breadth First Traversal of a Graph | [bfsDemo.cpp](graph_problems/bfsDemo.cpp) |
| calculate the shortest distance from the start position (Node S) to all of the other nodes in the graph using Dijkstra algorithm. | [dijkstra-shortest-reach.cpp](graph_problems/dijkstra-shortest-reach.cpp)|
| Calculate total weight of Minimum Spanning Tree of a given graph ( sum of weights of edges which forms MST) using Prim's algorithm | [primsMST.cpp](graph_problems/primsMST.cpp)|
| Print Minimum Spanning Tree( MST ) of a given graph using Kruskal's algorithm.| [kruskalMST.cpp](graph_problems/kruskalMST.cpp)|
| Create a program to generate a Huffman encoding for each character as a table.|[huffman_encoding.cpp](greedy_problems/huffman_encoding.cpp)|
| Search a given word in a 2D board containing letters. The word can be constructed by sequentially traversing adjacent horizontal or vertical cells. In a sequence to form word, letter on same position can not be used more than once. (Check top of file for examples.)|[grid_word_search.cpp](graph_problems/grid_word_search.cpp)|
| Given a 2D screen, location of the pixel and new value of the color to fill, replace the color of the pixel and all the adjacent(up, below, left, right) same colored pixel with new color. This is same as flood fill (remember the bucket symbol) a region in MS-PAINT.| [flood_fill.cpp](graph_problems/flood_fill.cpp)|
