| Given two integer arrays, A and B, each containing N integers. You are free to permute the order of the elements in the arrays. Is there an permutation A', B' possible of A and B, such that, A'<sub>i</sub>+B'<sub>i</sub> â‰¥ K for all i, where A'<sub>i</sub> denotes the i<sup>th</sup> element in the array A' and B'<sub>i</sub> denotes i<sup>th</sup> element in the array B'.| [two_arrays.cpp](greedy_problems/two_arrays.cpp)|
| John is taking orders. The i<sup>th</sup> order is placed by the i<sup>th</sup> customer at t<sub>i</sub> time and it takes d<sub>i</sub> time to procees. What is the order in which the customers will get their orders? (see more details in solutions's comments)|[orders_order.cpp](greedy_problems/orders_order.cpp)|
