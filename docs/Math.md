| Problem | Solution |
| :------------ | :----------: |
|  Print all the permutations of a string. Example: Permutations of ABC are ABC, ACB, BCA, BAC, CAB, CBA | [string_permutations.cpp](math_problems/string_permutations.cpp) |
| Euclidean algorithm to find greatest common divisor of two numbers. (Iterative and recursive)|[gcd.cpp](math_problems/gcd.cpp)|
| Implement pow(x,y) using divide and conquer approach. Try implementing it in O(logn)| [pow.cpp](math_problems/pow.cpp)|
| Calculate factorial of large number, say 100 (it will have 158 digits) |[factorial_of_large_num.cpp](math_problems/factorial_of_large_num.cpp)|
| Generate all possible words from a number entered on a traditional mobile keypad | [phone_digits.cpp](math_problems/phone_digits.cpp)|
| Given a string representation of a number, remove n characters from the string such that number representation is lowest possible.| [lowest_possible_number.cpp](math_problems/lowest_possible_number.cpp)|
| Detect if a number is a happy number. A number is happy number if sequence of operations where number is replaced by sum of square of its digits leads eventually to 1. A number is not a happy number if we are in an infinite loop when above operations are performed.| [happy_number.cpp](math_problems/happy_number.cpp)|
